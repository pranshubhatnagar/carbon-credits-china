## Introduction:

Emission trading markets have emerged as pivotal instruments in mitigating climate change, yet the dynamics of price discovery within these markets remain relatively underexplored. This proposal aims to investigate and compare price jumps within two significant emission trading markets: the established EU ETS and the burgeoning Chinese emission trading market. By situating this research within the context of existing studies, this project seeks to fill a prevailing gap in understanding, thereby contributing profoundly to the field of emission trading market dynamics.
Problem Statement:

The phenomenon of price discovery in emission trading market is one among the few research questions that have been in the mind of the policy makers, industry experts, business and academicians. This is because of the nascent stage of the market and huge scope for further exploration in the domain needs to be addressed. The price jump component along with the drift and volatility as explained by Merton (1976) after the Black-Scholes model (1973) adds to the relevance in completely understanding the pricing in Carbon markets. As carbon emissions from Europe have slowly been decreasing the carbon emissions trading market has been stabilizing and is becoming more understandable. The Chinese Scheme, on the other hand, has been setup recently and has taken the European Trading Schemes as its guiding pillars. The review seeks to identify key contributors, assess current research trends, identify gaps in understanding, and analyze price jumps in the newly set up Emission Trading System of China by making use of the research already done on the European Emissions Trading Schemes and placing it within the context of the larger field for other Emissions Trading Schemes. 

#### The Chinese Carbon Market

In 2015, at the Conference of Parties, China committed to reducing its carbon intensity per unit of GDP by 60–65% by 2030. To fulfill this pledge, China opted for market-based mechanisms like the UN-run Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The objective was to establish an international market facilitating exchanges where emission allowances are traded, and carbon emissions are monitored and reported, mirroring systems found in Europe and California.

During the 2010s, China initiated seven pilot carbon markets in diverse zones primarily involved in the production of cement, electricity, heat, petroleum, and oil extraction. These zones encompass Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Tianjin, collectively representing 25% of China's total GDP. These industries are recognized as major polluters and significant greenhouse gas emitters. An estimated 40.24 million metric tons of carbon dioxide were traded in these pilot zones by 2016, demonstrating the efficacy of the cap and trade model.

Publicly announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping during a 2015 visit to the United States White House, China expressed its intention to develop a national carbon emissions trading system. As outlined in the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (spanning 2016-2020), the government mandated the establishment of regulations for this national system. In December 2017, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) officially announced the system's creation, which has been active in full operation since 2021.

The emergence of new emission trading markets like the Chinese ones introduces opportunities to explore questions about the price discovery process in a novel way. 
 

### Literature Review
Merton's work on the price jump component, along with the foundational Black-Scholes model, is critical to understanding pricing dynamics in financial markets. Their contributions are especially pertinent in the complex environment of carbon markets.
Chang et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive study on emissions trading markets, revealing factors influencing price dynamics. Their research contributes to a better understanding of emission trading markets.
Convery et al. (2020) investigated price discovery mechanisms and volatility jumps in carbon markets. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of how emissions trading markets, such as the EU ETS and China, operate in terms of market dynamics.
A study on carbon-oriented operational planning in coupled electricity and emission trading markets was also conducted by Yunqi Wang, Jing Qiu, Yuechuan Tao, and Junhua Zhao. They proposed a two-stage scheduling model to investigate the environmental benefits of consumers participating in both the electricity and carbon emission trading markets via active demand side management in depth.
George J. Jiang, Ingrid Lo, and Adrien Verdelhan's study on information shocks, liquidity shocks, jumps, and price discovery is another significant contribution to the field. They identified price increases in US Treasury bonds and investigated what causes such large price changes. Their research also demonstrates that preannouncement liquidity shocks, such as changes in the bid-ask spread and market depth, have a strong predictive power for jumps. Even after accounting for information shocks, this predictive power is significant.
Research Trends and Common Findings
According to the current body of research in emission trading markets, there is a growing recognition of the significance of price jumps, volatility, and overall market dynamics. Scholars have recognized that these markets have distinct characteristics, and there is a growing interest in studying subcomponents such as price jumps, volatility jumps, and jump diffusions.
Common findings suggest that, while still in their infancy, emission trading markets are subject to a variety of factors that influence price movements. 
Cutting Edge within the Field
The development and application of advanced models to study specific aspects of emission trading markets constitutes cutting-edge research in the field. Recent studies by Lee and Chen (2021) used cutting-edge modelling techniques to examine the jump phenomenon in financial markets, revealing potential applications for emission trading markets.
Gap Identification
While previous research has provided useful insights into emission trading markets, there is a clear gap in explicitly understanding the price jump component in the context of the EU ETS and China's emission trading market. The Carbon Trading Market of the EU is currently twice as big in cap size as compared to the Chinese one but because of its population and GDP, the world's top greenhouse gas emitter’s ETS is currently the largest carbon market in the world by volume. The proposed study aims to close this gap by conducting an in-depth analysis using models developed by renowned researchers to uncover the characteristics of price increases in these specific markets.

### Methodology

•	Data Collection: While we have historical market data from the EU ETS, China's emission trading market is relatively new and not as stable. It is also difficult to get acuurate public information. We thus track the China Carbon Neutral Development Group Limited (1372.HK) from Yahoo Finance as a proxy for this. We are also evaluating China Shanghai and Energy Exchange’s SHEA Data from sources like CEIC to maintain the sanctity of the data.

•	Statistical Analysis: Utilize established models and statistical techniques to identify and analyze occurrences of price jumps. We are trying to replicate the features used for European Markets’ analysis for Chinese Emissions Markets too.

•	Comparative Analysis: We have already started to compare and contrast the year on year characteristics of the two markets using the OWID dataset. We will be using these factors to normalize the data of the two markets and make them more comparable to each other. 

Conclusion
There is a rich tapestry of research in emission trading markets, with a particular emphasis on price discovery. This research project aims to provide a deeper understanding of price jumps within emission trading markets, specifically focusing on the EU ETS and China's emission trading market. By filling the existing gap in understanding and offering unique perspectives, this study aspires to contribute substantially to the advancement of knowledge in this crucial domain of emission trading market dynamics.
